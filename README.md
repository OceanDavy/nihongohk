Download and run the APP by using "npm start".
The project was made to learn and understand the core concepts of ReactJS and how the components can interact with each other,
since I like Japanese Culture I thought that creating a Flashcard game about the Japanese Syllabary would be a cool and interesting way to learn this Library.

The game has 2 buttons:
• Hiragana 
• Katakana

Each one of them will display their specific charts
After you pressed a button it will display in the box down below 
a Symbol (hiragana / katakana chart) and 3 options in the romaji format.

Every correct answer will give you 5+ points to your score, you have only 1 opportunity to choose the correct answer
if you choose the incorrect answer the game will end and your score will be reseted.

This is a good way to practice your Hiragana and Katakana !

Have fun! .- David
